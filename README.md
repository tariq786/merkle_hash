Its a good exercise. Because of time pressure, i didn't do the recursive solution as i was getting stuck with that. Its not that i don't know recursion. The reason is because inner node is different than leaf node. Because of time pressure,i could not remain stuck at the problem. If you have the time to watch the commits, you will see an interesting pattern going back and forth.

I have made sure that insertion works correctly to my best. find method is renamed to has_key(). Feel free to check this

I have asked a question on stackoverflow.
