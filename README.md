Hash is also working.
Find is also working
Insert is also working.

I didn't change Insert and find's implementation to recursive to save time although this can be done as the current implementation is recursive. This can be seen by hash implementation, which is purely recursive function.

Some error checking on input is missing as i thought to update the code on git first.

All is well that ends well :)
